1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Execute the `start.bat` file in the root directory using the Command Line (CLI).

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
